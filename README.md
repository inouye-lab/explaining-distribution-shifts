# Code to recreate experiments from Towards Explaining Distribution Shifts

To recreate the results for the experiment, first create the corresponding environment (via conda by `conda env create -f environment.yml`).

Then unzip the `data.zip` file.

Then you should be able to recreate the experiments via running the corresponding jupyter notebook.

Cheers!
